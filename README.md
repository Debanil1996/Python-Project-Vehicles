## 📍 Overview

The Python Vehicle Project is a data-driven, machine learning Python initiative designed to analyze and process vehicle-related data. Using a range of libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn, it performs data manipulation, numerical computations, data visualization and applies machine learning algorithms. This offering posits a compelling proposition for those seeking to delve into automotive analytics and predictive modelling.

Here this is a system where we are analyzing a AirBus Management System Sample where the main purpose of this architecture is that here we can see how vehicles are used in a business similar to  Car Rental System connecting Drivers with Airbus
First all the operations corresponding to AirBus Management System is related to different Statuses mainly the document Status where the Vehicle undergoes operation to Move from the Business Premises to customer

Here we are denoting 3 business models based on which the architecture is made about .
1. **Vehicles** - This is the business model which is the base like these are the vehicles which the customer will utilize or take a rent of these vehicles from the business client .
1. **Prospects** - This is the next business model corresponding to the customers who have came to take up the vehicles
1. **Champions** - This is the next ongoing business model corresponding to the customers who are potential prospects binded with the vehicles and are ready to take out the vehicle .

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The architecture is a single Jupyter notebook. Data preprocessing, model training, and visualization occur linearly, with less focus on system design. |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The flow is corresponding to vehicles which are used by customers to send accross the systems .The Architecture is like [architecturelink](./Revised%20V1%20toV2%20Flow%20in%20Production-Activation%20Flow.jpg) |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | Main dependencies are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn, which cover a broad range of data processing, analysis, visualization and machine learning.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | Modularity is limited due to the use of a single notebook. However, logical separation of code cells partially compensates for this.|
